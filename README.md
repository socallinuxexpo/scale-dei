# Scale Diversity Scripts

## Scale CFP data

Once logged in, download data from:

[https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/demographics.csv](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/demographics.csv)

But change `22x` to the desired year.

Then run [diversity_reports.rb](src/diversity_reports.rb) on it and stick it in
the spreadsheet.

## Attendee Data

Currently this is manually requested from Lei.
